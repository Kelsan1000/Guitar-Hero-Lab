 **********************************************************************/

We have a separate RingBuffer class in order to create a queue object 
that can be used in the GuitarString class to hold in values.


/**********************************************************************
 *  If you did one of the extra credits, name which one you did, 
 *  describe it here and write why it is interesting.

Playing a song with our guitarhero class seemed like it was fun to do 
and we get to see our program work.
